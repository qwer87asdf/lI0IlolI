<h3>About Muslims Day App</h3>
<p>Alhamdulillah. Since 2015 we have been developing this App.</p>
<p>From 2015 to 2020, the name of our App was <strong>App of Ramadan</strong>. After 5 years of development, this app has lots of features and functionalities. So we renamed it to <strong>Muslims Day</strong>. We are trying to include a complete guideline of a muslim.</p>
<p>First 3 years of release, we showed Google Ad in our app. But most of the time the Ad content is against Islam. Because of the Haram content of Ad, we turned off the Ad showing system. So we don&rsquo;t have any regular income from this App to continue our development except <strong>your donation</strong>.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We have been developing this app under the banner of <a href="https://megaminds.technology/" target="_blank">Megaminds Technologies</a>. Everyone involved in its management is a professional software engineer. Everyone is working as a software engineer in several private companies. Besides, we work for Muslim Day before and after office work and on holidays.</p>
<p>The team lead of Muslim's Day Project studied at Madrasah. Other members of the team also keep in touch with the Islamic scholars and try to follow the Islam.</p>
<p>Regarding the app, we try to take the advice and guidance of the scholars of Qawmi Madrasah of Hanafi Madhhab.</p>
<h3>Our Aqeedah</h3>
<p>We hold the aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaat. We try to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), the Companions (peace be upon him) and the deeds and guidelines of the Tabye and Tabe-Tabye.</p>
<p>We try to stay away from all shirk and bidat. Which is reflected in this app.</p>
<h3>Our Madhab</h3>
<p>We follow Hanafi in fiqh. As well as respecting other schools of thought. We don't think other schools of thought are wrong. We think the opinion of our madhhab is best. The other opinion is also good. If anyone disagrees with our fiqh, we do not hate him for it. We try to stay away from sectarian debates and separatism.</p>
<p>Since most people in Bangladesh follow the Hanafi Madhab. So the default settings of the app and the Masalah are given according to Hanafi Fiqh. At the same time, we try to mention the opinions of other schools of thought. Due to the limitations of our knowledge, it may not be possible all the time.</p>
