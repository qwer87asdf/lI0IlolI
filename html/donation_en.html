<h2>Donate for Muslims Day App development</h2>
<p>To build a house you have to buy space, bricks and sand etc. You have to pay engineers and labor costs. The same thing goes for App development. We have to pay Engineers on a regular basis. The house needs to be repaired more or less every month. In the same way, software engineers have to work for the app every day.<br /><br />That's why we need your financial support for this project.</p>
<h3>Why do we ask for donations?</h3>
<p>The main way to earn money from the app in Bangladesh is to show Google ads on the app. There is no income when users download or use the app. If we show Google Ad, then we can get money from Google. But many advertisements show haraam products or obscene content. This violates the rule of Islam. So we have closed this way of earning.<br /><br />But how are the engineers' payments made? Through the donations you send!<br /><br />If you have benefited from this app. If you want to keep this app running in the future. Then you can donate here as much as you can. If you donate monthly at least 100 TK, it will also take the project a long way. InshaAllah, it will be considered as sadakaye zaria for you.<br /><br /><strong><em>Note: Zakat, Fitra, Mannat, money for the skin of the sacrificial animal cannot be given here. Even if someone gives it, it will not be acceptable. It is a simple sadaqa, which can be given as a gift.</em></strong></p>
